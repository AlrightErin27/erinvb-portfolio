            Being a software engineer requires more than knowing how to code or
            build a web application. This program teaches you to learn to think,
            and build, like software engineers — from developing coding
            proficiency to gaining an understanding of how products are designed
            and managed. Students develop key skills through interactive labs,
            lectures, and close collaboration, showcasing progress through
            Portfolio Projects. While the bulk of the material covered
            encompasses the Ruby and JavaScript ecosystems, we carefully
            designed our curriculum to prepare students to launch software
            engineering careers, independent of any specific language or
            technology.
